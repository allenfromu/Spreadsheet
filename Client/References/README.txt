From PS4: Very few methods from Formula and DependencyGraph are used in the implementation of a spreadsheet at this stage.

PS5:
2014 October 07: Branched solution from PS4.
2014 October 14: Realized I haven't been using the name normalizer at all, going through and updating everywhere it should be used.
2014 October 14: Seemingly everything is working, now to implement saving/reading XML.
2014 October 15: It looks like everything is done, going to write a couple more tests to ensure that is the case.

PS6:
2014 November 03: Branched solution from PS5. Commented SpreadsheetPanel and began building SpreadsheetGUI. Close and Save work. Added shortcut keys for all menu items.
2014 November 05: New and Open work. Added labels for cell name, value, and contents boxes. Added value tooltips! Made Help. 
					Coded UI Tests are the most frusterating, buggy feature of Visual Studio. They only work sporadically.
					Eventually made the tests work fairly regularly.
					Added tooltips to everything in the File menu.
					Added Average and Median features.
